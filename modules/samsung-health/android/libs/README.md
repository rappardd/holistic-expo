# Samsung Health SDK

Place the `samsung-health-data-api.aar` file in this directory.

## Download Instructions

1. Visit the [Samsung Developer Portal](https://developer.samsung.com/health/data/guide/introduction.html)
2. Sign up for a Samsung Developer account if you don't have one
3. Navigate to the Samsung Health Data SDK section
4. Download the `samsung-health-data-api.aar` file
5. Place it in this directory (`mobile/modules/samsung-health/android/libs/`)

## File Structure
```
libs/
└── samsung-health-data-api.aar  # Place the downloaded AAR file here
```

The build will fail without this file, as it's required for the Samsung Health integration to work.
